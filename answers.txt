* what is debouncing technique  and why it useful ?

2-Enhances User Experience: Avoids jittery behavior caused by rapid event triggers.
3-Common Use Cases:
   Typing in a search bar (trigger after pause).
   Resizing the window (trigger after resizing stops).
   Scrolling (trigger analytics or lazy-loading).
